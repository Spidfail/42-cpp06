# 42-cpp06
Seventh day of the 42 school's C++ learning path.

## How to use it

There is a Makefile for compiling (`make`) cleaning the project (`make clean`, `make fclean`) and rebuild it (`make re`).

## Tasks

The day is focused on the practice of `casts` in C++, serialization/deserialization, `rand()` and the other concepts learned before (especially the 3rd exercise).
